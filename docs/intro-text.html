<p>The Division of Water Rights' Enforcement Section maintains this searchable list of water rights and/or claims of right it believes are subject to the Senate Bill 88 Measurement Regulations but appear to have either made no attempt at complying or have indicated measuring devices have been installed but the required associated datafiles have not been submitted. An "X" in the <b>Missing Device Report(s)</b> column indicates that a Measuring Device has not been registered for that right or claim of right. An "X" in the <b>Missing Datafile(s)</b> column indicates that measurement datafiles have not been submitted for that right or claim of right for the 2019 and/or 2020 reporting years. The list is updated around the beginning of each month. Water Rights within the Legal Delta are not included in the the list.</p>
<p>Please refer to the Division's <a href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/diversion_use/water_measurement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Water Measurement Regulations</a> web page for guidance on how to measure diversions and submit measurement datafiles. If you believe your water right(s) or claim(s) of right were incorrectly identified as being subject to the measurement regulations, please send an email to our <a href="mailto://dwr-measurement@waterboards.ca.gov">Division of Water Rights Measurement email box</a>.</p>
